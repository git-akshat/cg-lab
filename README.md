1. Write a program to demonstrate the following OpenGL primitives with either RGB or indexed colors(as suggested by examiner):
- GL_POINTS
- GL_LINES 
- GL_LINE_STRIP 
- GL_LINE_LOOP
- GL_TRIANGLES 
- GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
- GL_TRIANGLE_FAN
- GL_QUADS 
- GL_QUAD_STRIP
- GL_POLYGON 

2. Write a program to demonstrate the two views, orthographic view and perspective view, of OpenGL by consider a 2D and a 3D with any two primitives.

3. Write a program to deisgn a scenery by using the following OpenGL buit-in shapes.

| glutSolidSphere(float radius, int slices, int stacks) | Circle | Sphere | Choose an integer 20-100 for the slices and stacks arguments; the higher the number, the more accurate the sphere/circle. |
| glutSolidCube(double size) | Square | Cube | |
| glutSolidCone(double base, double height, int slices, int stacks) | Triangle | Cone | The greater the slices argument is, the smoother the cone will appear. |
| glutSolidTorus(double innerRadius, double outerRadius, int nSides, int rings) |  | Torus | |
| glutSolidTeapot(float radius) | | | |

5. Write a program to demonstrate the plotting of implicit functions with marching
squares technique.
6. Write a simple CAD program to model the polygons as follows:
i)Creating 2D polygons.
ii)Selection of a Polygon.
iii)Deletion of a polygon.
7.Write a program to demonstrate the OpenGL transformation functions with any of
the suitable primitive for the following transformations:
i)Translate
ii)Scale
iii)Roate
8. Write an animated program to construct a car like structure on a track and perform
the following in a menu:
i)start the car
ii)change dirction of moving car from left to right and vise versa.
iii) increase and decrease the speed
iv)stop the car.
v) a sub menu to change color of the car body.
9. Write a program to fill a 3D cube with a set of six colors for its six faces with the Zbuffer hidden surface removal algorithm. Allow the user to view all faces of the cube
with rotation.

algorithms:(Examiner's choice)
i) Flood fill
ii) Scan-Line fill
